        <p>
          Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to
          making science accessible to all.

          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
          experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
          lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

          We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
          to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
          exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
          these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
          to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they
          only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

      <h2>FOR TEACHERS</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
          places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
          students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
          laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and
          inspire them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our facilities
          and to arrange a time to bring your students through for a visit.

        <h2>EVOLUTION</h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
          understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
          from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.

          <p>
            Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you
            sleep over beside dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own
            sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we go exploring the
            wonders of science.

          <h2>ENERGETICA EXHIBITION ON LOAN</h2>
          <p>
            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.
