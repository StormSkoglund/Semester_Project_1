          There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very
          welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and
          accessible to the whole community.

          You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museumâ€™s
          collections. If you have some item or collection that you think others
          would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections
          Department and they will be able to assist you.
