              On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
              exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a
              series of installations that allow visitors to experience the
              power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy
              powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are
              able to use and control wind to create power.
