        <h2>ENERGETICA EXHIBITION ON LOAN</h2>
        <p>
          On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
          exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series of
          installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
          elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
          ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind
          to create power.
