            <figcaption>
              Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun
              and excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with people? Well
              you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the
              museum. You’ll be learning from a number of different academics
              and people who are passionate about science and sharing it with
              the wider community.

              Are you looking to get involved with our team of researchers and
              academics? Our museum offers various ways for you to use our
              resources and contribute towards them.
              <p>
                We have online records, laboratory space, and a working
                relationship with a number of universities around the country.

            <h2>VOLUNTEER</h2>
            <figcaption>
              A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
              displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy.
              <p>
                Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the
                scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a
                monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
                discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please
