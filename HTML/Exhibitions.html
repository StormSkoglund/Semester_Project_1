        <h2>ROBOTICS AND AI</h2>
        <p>
          The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
          intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
          applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.
          You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

        <h2>Prof. Sheila Widnall</h2>
        <p>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</p>
        <h2>COSMOLOGY</h2>
        <p>
          Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky
          Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about
          the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and
          galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators
          who used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar
          exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the
          latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures on
          the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this
          exciting ‘space’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prof. Sheila Widnall will be giving her first lecture on the 5th of
          June, 2023. The lecture will take place in the Community Science
          Museum Auditorium at 3:15 PM.

        <h2>EVOLUTION</h2>
        <p>
          For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
          question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
          here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
          framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
          know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet
          a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
          Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

        <h2>BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE</h2>
        p From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology
        are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny
        world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
        quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding
        of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of
        medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the
        discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.

        <h2>ECOLOGY</h2>
        <p>
          As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
          planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
          create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
          planet.
