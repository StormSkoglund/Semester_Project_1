My second website.

## Description
The Community Science Museum: This website was created solely with CSS and HTML. The idea was to emulate a real museum with plenty of events and content. The site was heavy on copy and therefore it also needed many pages.


## Built With

-HTML
-CSS

### Running

How to launch my site:

Please install the "Live Server" Plugin via your extensions menu in Visual Studio Code, or copy the path of the index.html file and paste it directly in your browser. You can also drag and drop the index.html into your browser.
